# Sample Smart Contracts

Test smart contracts to use with my account abstraction examples.

## BestPetPoll.sol

This contract is deployed [here](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xf6B35b22C9dB8caD52e537012AB569E71CB3e532) on the Polygon testnet.

There is a Best Pet Poll frontend ([GitHub repo here](https://github.com/sw-3/best-pet-poll)), allowing users to vote for their favorite kind of pet. The votes are tracked via this smart contract.

## ScottsMood.sol

This contract is not deployed or used, but it functions and the tests pass.
I have no current plans to use it further.
